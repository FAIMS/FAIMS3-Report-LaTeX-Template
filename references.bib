  abstract = "FAIMS Mobile is a native Android application supported by an
              Ubuntu server facilitating human-mediated field research across
              disciplines. It consists of `core' Java and Ruby software
              providing a platform for data capture, which can be deeply
              customised using `definition packets' consisting of XML documents
              (data schema and UI) and Beanshell scripts (automation).
              Definition packets can also be generated using an XML-based
              domain-specific language, making customisation easier. FAIMS
              Mobile includes features allowing rich and efficient data capture
              tailored to the needs of fieldwork. It also promotes synthetic
              research and improves transparency and reproducibility through
              the production of comprehensive datasets that can be mapped to
              vocabularies or ontologies as they are created.",

  abstract     = "Data collection is fundamental to water and environmental
                  management. Streamflows, reservoir elevations, and flows in
                  canals and conduits, for example, are continuously monitored
                  to support decisions ranging from real-time operations to
                  long-term planning. Data are routinely collected to monitor
                  infrastructure conditions and identify maintenance
                  priorities, and a wide range of environmental data are
                  collected to characterize habitat conditions, monitor fish
                  and wildlife populations, and support ecosystem restoration
                  programs. Scientists, engineers, and technicians are
                  increasingly using mobile devices such as tablets and
                  smartphones to record measurements, document site locations
                  via GPS, and take photos and notes in the field. Numerous
                  apps are already available to support general data
                  collection; however, these apps do not provide the
                  functionality and flexibility needed to support the broad
                  range of water and environmental monitoring needs. For
                  example, most existing apps are unable to interface with
                  field instruments (e.g., sensors and data loggers), and many
                  have limited options for exporting data. Development of a
                  flexible, extensible, and open source data collection app
                  framework for mobile devices will facilitate the use of
                  mobile devices for field data collection, which in turn will
                  improve data collection efficiency, lower data collection
                  costs, and improve data quality, transparency, and
                  dissemination for applications to management, decision
                  making, and scientific discovery.",
